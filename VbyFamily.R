#Plot for Vulnerability Scores per Family

#1. Install & Load required libraries
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("dplyr")
installed.packages("ggplot2")

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#2. Read the CSV file
vdata <- read.csv("/Users/findingjemo/Documents/PSA/PH/FamilyV.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#3. Summarize data by grouping by family & getting mean V, then order to show decreasing V
summary_stats <- vdata %>%
  group_by(Family) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_v = mean(Vulnerability, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_v = min(Vulnerability, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_v = max(Vulnerability, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_v)) %>%
  mutate(Family = factor(Family, levels = Family))

#4. Make bar plot w/ bar showing range, mean V shown as a line & V scores as dots
